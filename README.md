#Facebook ESB Connector

The Facebook connector allows you to access the exposed Facebook Graph API from WSO2 ESB. Facebook is an online social networking website that allows registered users to create profiles, upload photos and videos, send messages, and keep in touch with their family, friends, and colleagues. The Graph API is the primary way to get data back and forth, from and to Facebook's social graph.
